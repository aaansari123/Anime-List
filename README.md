# Anime-List

# Description

We created an anime film finder. We retrieved data that allows the user to view the anime title, a link to MyAnimeList, which shows the number of episodes along with how long each episode is on average when the anime was released, the rating the anime has received, and finally a famous quote from the anime that the user searches for. This is useful for someone who wants more information about a specific anime. Additionally, when the user searches for an anime, the anime will be added to your watch list to keep track of what the user is watching or interested in watching. And when the user finishes that anime or doesn't want it on their watchlist, they can click on the item and it will be removed from the watchlist and moved to the removed section. Making it easy for the user to keep track of the animes they are interested in.
